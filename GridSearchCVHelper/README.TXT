There are 2 ways to use the helper code :
1) Import the python file to your notebook as a library and pass in X,y values. 
   The output order will be best score, best parameters, mean accuracy and the best fit model in that order.
   Sample usage: best_score,best_param,mean_acc,RF_model=GridCV_Helper.GridCV(X,y)
   
2) Copy parts of the code into your own code and edit parameters according to your requirement.(RECOMMENDED)
